# JSON Database

In order to ensure that I was avoiding pre-existing accounts while prospecting for new leads, I needed a way in which I could view all of the accounts. Being in Maine, where reception is hit and miss, I figured it would be best to have JavaScript load a JSON file once after which point I could continue searching it while in Airplane Mode.

**Notes:**
- The *data.json* does need to be manually updated periodically (maybe weekly)
